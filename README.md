# Sales-Insights-Power-BI-Project

The project involves gathering sales data, cleaning and transforming it using SQL, and building a Power BI dashboard to visualize key sales metrics. The goal is to provide actionable insights to the sales director for better decision-making. 

Project Overview:

Problem Statement:
The organization’s sales data existed in scattered files and systems, making it difficult for leadership to monitor performance and take timely decisions. There was no analytical solution to track revenue trends, identify top customers or products, and compare performance across regions. This lack of insights created challenges in resource planning, inventory control, and revenue optimization.

Project Objective:

1. A centralized view of overall sales performance

2. Analysis of revenue and sales quantity trends over time

3. Customer and city-level contribution to revenue

4. Identification of top-performing products and customers

5. Dynamic filtering for quick decision-making


 Data Model & Technology Stack
 
The dashboard was developed using Power BI Desktop, which serves as the primary business intelligence tool. Data was cleaned, transformed, and prepared using Power Query to ensure accuracy and consistency. Key business logic and analytical measures were created using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions). The dataset used in this project was sourced from Excel/CSV files containing sales records. The visualizations in the report include KPI cards, bar charts, line charts, and slicers, which enhance interactivity and make insights easy to interpret.

Insights & Observations

✔ Delhi is the top revenue-generating city

✔ A few top customers (e.g., major electrical stores) contribute significantly to overall revenue

✔ Product sales are concentrated — identifying key products helps inventory decisions

✔ Revenue is seasonal and fluctuating, requiring strategic focus in low-revenue months

✔ Certain cities show limited sales opportunities, guiding expansion strategy
